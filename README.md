# Introduction
In a world where cinema is not just entertainment but a mirror to society, understanding the representation of women on screen is paramount. For the last decades, the Bechdel test has been a cornerstone in assessing this representation, yet its simplicity often overshadows its limitations. This narrative ventures beyond the Bechdel test, unveiling a new landscape of metrics that offer a richer, more nuanced view of women in cinema.

# The Bechdel test explained
Before we can really assess the strengths and weaknesses of the Bechdel we need to define for the reader what it exactly entails. Conceived by Alison Bechdel in 1985, the Bechdel Test asks a straightforward question: does a movie feature at least two women who talk to each other about something besides a man? More specifically the test consists of the following three conditions:

1. The movie has to have at least two women in it,
2. who talk to each other,
3. about something other than a man

This thus means that the Bechdel test can be considered as a discrete scoring from 0 (complete fail) to 3 (pass). 

# The Bechdel test analysed
Given the advent of spoken cinema in the early 1930s, one might assume that women's representation in film would have progressed alongside growing gender equality and women's involvement in society at large, potentially resulting in higher Bechdel test scores. However, we need to investigate whether this assumption holds true or if it is merely a perception. The following analysis aims to address this question directly.
